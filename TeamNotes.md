Try to check this document whenever you start working on the project to see any notes we need to share with each other. We used something like this for the warmup project and it worked well as we used it alongside Trello. -JH

## Announcements for Everyone
Post notes here everyone should see and try to check it whenever you start working. Put your initials in the "(seen by: \<put em here>)" when you read each thing.

1. It seemed like we agreed on repl.it for development so [here's a link](https://repl.it/@jackson_hall/CS205-Final-Project) to where the project will be. Make sure to go into settings on the left and change tab spaces to 4 and tab characters to spaces (not the \t tab char), Python can error out when mixing spaces and tabs and it's so much easier to set this up from the beginning -JH (seen by: )
.. Jason said in his notes on our warmup project we should have followed [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Python formatting and use snake_case for vars and functions, and CapWords for classes -JH (seen by: )
.. I try to keep classes organized into these sections so just dropping them here to copy-paste when we make new classes -JH (seen by: )
  ```
  class ClassName:
      ''' ========== Constant Class Variables ========== '''
      ''' ========== Regular Class Variables ========== '''
      ''' ========== Constructor ========== '''
      ''' ========== Magic Methods ========== '''
      ''' ========== Static Methods ========== '''
      ''' ========== Instance Methods ========== '''
  ```
